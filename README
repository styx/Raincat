Raincat
Game Creation Society - Fall 08
www.gamecreation.org


HOW TO START THE GAME:
----------------------
./raincat


CHANGELOG:
----------
Version 1.1:
    - Changed initial item placement from click to select, click to place
      to drag n' drop.
    - Replaced eraser tool with right click to erase an item
    - Now properly detecting mouse clicks after window resize
Version 1.0:
    - Initial version


NOTES:
------
The Raincat executable was compiled with GHC 6.12.1 on Arch Linux i686
and on Ubuntu 9.10. If you are having problems running the game, the
win32 build runs under wine.

Runtimes for the following libraries are assumed to be installed:
GLUT
OpenGL
SDL
SDL_image
SDL_mixer


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
If you receive the error:
"user error (Mix_LoadMUS SDL message: Module format not recognized)"
when trying to run Raincat, this is because your SDL-mixer library
was not compiled with mp3 support. You will need to recompile that
with mp3 support or otherwise obtain a copy with mp3 support in order
to run the game.
